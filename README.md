## Can I Cook It (Front-end)

Can I Cook It, or CICI is a web app designed to assist users with grocery management when meal planning for week long intervals. Users catalog their ingredient inventory, manage and create custom recipes and build their own meal plans utilizing the recipes they have saved. A user may generate a grocery list for all the missing ingredients and their quantities required to implement a meal plan. Finally, a user may implement a meal plan which would deduct all ingredients required from their ingredient inventory.
